# InTheGym

In The Gym is an IOS mobile application for monitoring workload in the gym. It was created using XCode and Swift and uses Google Firebase as a backend Database. In The Gym allows the user to create either a Coach or Player profile. A coach profile will allow the user to send requests to players using their username. If the player accepts the request they then become part of the team.

The interfaces differ slightly for coaches and players. Both users would see an Activity Page and a My Info page. The Activity Page displays everything the user has done including accepting a new coach, completing a workout and updating PBs. The My Info page displays information like personal information, number of workouts complete and the difficulty scores.
